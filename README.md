# Music_Analysis
- This is the analysis I have done about the music industry based on spotify.
- There is a file which I failed to upload on github due to its size but you can download the dataset from the kaggle link I included in my code.
- I am personally interested in music and tried to analysis the correlationships between the elements consisting the song and its popularity.
- I had some fun with dynamic graphs.
- I also created a few graphs and added explanation to clarify the common aspects of those songs that are less famous considering the artist's popularity and those which are famous despite the less known artist.
